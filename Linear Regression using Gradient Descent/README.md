- Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

According to a set of x and y coordinates to predict a line, which is represented by 'w' as its slope and 'b' as its intercept.

Construct computation graph to calculate the gradient for both 'w' and 'b', so that it could apply gradient descent to updating both parameters and finally converge.

- Pytorch__Linear Regression

Applying pytorch to achieve quadric fitting

Autograd is so useful!!!
